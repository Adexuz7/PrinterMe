# PRINTERME 

PrinterMe is our Social Media Web created to help people to find 3D printers as a service for their projects. Also you can find 3D models to print!

# Installation

You have to install all the npm packages (```$npm install```) from your console to use it.

# Usage

Actually PrinterMe is developed to be a Back-end project, so it's not going to have a Front. By the way, you can use it installing all the npm packages and doing all the request in Postman.

# Usage

As every Social Media, you're going to have a Profile with a follow/follower system, a Timeline to be always wondered by the publications and comments of your followed users, an Explore site to watch new publications of random people and Groups, to make great communities to support you in case of any doubt you would have.

# Roadmap

We would like to implement the following ideas in the future:
* Fully functional Groups.
* Private user profiles and groups.
* A Business profile.
* An awesome and colorfull Front-end
